## PORTFOLIO Website

####MILESTONES ACHIEVED :

1. Fetching latitude and longitude of a given location through API (opencagedata.com)
2. Fetching weather of given location through API call (openweathermap.org)
3. Fetching location’s weather for a past date and displaying weather of current location on website opening.
4. _OPTIONAL MILESTONES_ :  Customizing website according to weather

#### TECH STACK :

- HTML
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap

#### DESCRIPTION :

I designed the site using well synchronised colour schemes. I laid special focus on making the site mobile-friendy. The page cntains largely 3 section that display current weather, forecast and past history of a place. As soon as the website is loaded, there is a prompt to grant permission to share the location of the device. If we grant the permission within 10 seconds, the page displays the weather of current location or else it displays the weather of default location. The page is designed such that it changes appearance according to the current weather. Second section displays next five-day forecast and clicking on each of them will reveal details. The third section displays the weather of last five days and clicking them too reveals the details. The custom scrolling makes the scrolling swifter and enhances user experience.

#### KEY FEATURES :

- Absolutely **mobile-friendly** - adjusts layout according to the screen size
- Implemented **custom scrolling** for smoother scrolls 
- **Elegant** materiallistic look
- **Responsive** website
- **Error handling** and displaying through alert boxes
- **Auto-hiding** of header bar while scrolling down and show when sscrolling up

#### CHALLENGES FACED :

1. Perfecting layouts was really a big challenge
2. Making the website responsive
3. Handling of errors
4. Implementation of promises and fetch API

#### SCOPE OF IMPROVEMENT :

Environment variables could be used for API keys.

#### LEARNING OUTCOME :

This project was a great hands-on with promises, specifically fetch API. I learnt to fetch data from through an API and pocessing the JSON to extract the desired data. I also experimented with custom scrolling and responsive website.
