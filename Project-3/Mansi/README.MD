- It is a simple website wherein:

1.  final_weather_host has an html file which on running returns the weather details for today.
2.  previous_weather_host has an html file which running returns the weather details for last 5 days .
3.  after_weather_host has an html file which on running returns the weather details for the next 5 days .

    current loction.
