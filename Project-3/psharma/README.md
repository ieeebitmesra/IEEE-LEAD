  ### Tech Stack
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Java Script
  
 ### Description
 The project consists of use of various functionalities of HTML and CSS . 
 Image linking , various heading styles,input tags and button tags have been made using HTML tags and attributes.
 
 The page is styled using various features of CSS such as background,float ,oreintation features,media query (for responsive	webpage) .
 
The project is mostly written in JavaScript and uses various features such as taking input dynamically and using it to find weather.
The most important is use of  fetch to call api and using navigator to get current location.
 
 ### Unique
Getting weather of current location, displaying images according to current weather and day/night,buttons and overall layout of the page are some nice features
 
 ### Problems Faced
 First problem was to get current location .
 After searching I understood the use of navigator.geolocation to get my current coordinates  and then use reverse geocoding.
 Second was to get weather on a particular date.
 I was not able to solve this due to lack of time .
 
 ### Scope of Improvement
 I can add animation .
 Moreover, I would add a loader and design my web page to get weather of a particular date.
 
 ### What did I learn
 I learnt a lot as most of it was completey new.
 I learnt how to use fetch and call api and geocodind (to get current location).
 This was also my first experience to such extensive use of Java Script.
