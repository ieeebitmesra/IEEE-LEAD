<b>Description</b>

The website can give the user the current weather in his/her location, information like temperature, weather description of the day. It also provides weather information
of the upcoming 7 days and past 5 days. The user can also search for any city and get the current weather and all the above mentioned information for the searched city as well.
The user will also get to know of the latitude and longitude of his/her location or any city.

<b>Problems Faced</b>

Figuring out how to link the data provided in the response to required elements so that they are displayed properly. I tried to use Google maps autocomplete feature so while 
the user is typing suggestions are provided which help the user. But I couldn't make it work.

<b>Scope of Improvement</b>

Currently the website only gives weather information only if the user types the correct spelling of the location, it doesn't inform the user if he/she commits a mistake while
typing the location. So informing the user that the typed location is not correct or there is a spelling mistake so that he/she can correct the mistake. Or to eradicate this 
error by adding autocomplete feature so that the user gets a correct response everytime. Styling the website so that it is more responsive and good looking. 
Customizing the website according to the weather.
