**DESCRIPTION**

This is a price comparator app can also be used for searching Google for a desired product.The app furthur finds the first product on flipkart then uses the description of the item to search other online shopping platforms.


**UNIQUE**

To get the desired product the app gets the first item, it is more likely to follow the criteria, To compare the same products on different platforms the product description is picked and searched on different platforms


**PROBLEMS FACED**

I got stuck in scapping results from the webpages as some pages in flipkart have different page structures for some products and amazon doesn't allow a bot to scrape results


**SCOPE OF IMPROVEMENT**

GUI can be imporved and price can be compared on different online platforms there is a lot of corner cases to covered so that for every search query a appropriate product is displayed. However if a item is searched with proper query a suitable product will be display with maximum probability.
