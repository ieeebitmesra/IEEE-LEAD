## Description
The window is a simple gui creation. It first asks for a user input to search an item. Then it opens the first google search result for that. It then displays the product name and price from flipkart. Before displaying the product name and price it asks for the type of product-'Electronics', 'Clothing and footwear' and 'Books, toys and more'. Then after it displays the top 7 results from amazon and then asks which product to compare. Then it displays the message of which website offers a better result.
## Unique
I tried to make it user friendly by impleting a gui. Also it displays top 7 results from amazon which provides more options for comparison
## Problems Faced
Class names from product names are different for different category of products. To solve that i had to ask the type of product from the user. Also price is retrieved as â‚¹xx,yyy so getting the number for comparison was also a task. Many times I got Attribute errors and other errors but google gave solutions.
## Scope of improvement
I could not display pictures for the results. I would like to add that. Also adding a scrollbar would make the window more spacious.
## What you learned?
It was a great experience. Each time i got stuck somewhere i learned to solve that without being complacent.This project definately made more patient to deal with errors and bugs.
